(“Biogen”), River Acquisition, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biogen and Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Reata”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Reata (the “Merger”), with Reata surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biogen.</p><p>The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by Biogen’s Board of Directors (the “Biogen Board”). Reata’s Board of Directors (the “Reata Board”) has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Reata and its stockholders, and declared it advisable for Reata to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution and delivery by Reata of the Merger Agreement, the performance by Reata of its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, (iii) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a special meeting of the stockholders of Reata (the “Reata Special Meeting”) and (iv) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of Reata.</p><p><em>Merger Consideration and Treatment of Equity Awards</em></p><p>Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Reata (the “Class A Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Reata (the “Class B Common Stock ” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Reata Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case except for (i) shares of Reata Common Stock owned by Biogen, Merger Sub or Reata, or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Biogen, Merger Sub or Reata, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) any shares of Reata Common Stock with respect to which statutory rights of appraisal have been properly and validly demanded) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $172.50 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the “Merger Consideration”). In addition, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding Reata stock option, whether vested or unvested, will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Reata Common Stock underlying such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of such option, and (ii) each outstanding Reata restricted stock unit (“RSU ”) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Reata Common Stock underlying such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration, in each case, subject to any applicable withholding taxes.</p><p><em>Representations, Warranties and Covenants</em></p><p>Each of Biogen, Merger Sub and Reata have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to cause each of the conditions to the Merger to be satisfied as promptly as practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement.</p><p><div style="border-left: 2px solid #aaa; background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 8px; border-radius: 4px">

        In addition, Reata has made customary covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants during the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time (i) to use reasonable best efforts to conduct its operations in all material respects according to its ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practice and preserve

       The clause provided does not completely align with the playbook's elements. <br><br>The clause starts well by stating that Reata has made customary covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others. However, the rest of the clause seems to be incomplete and lacks clarity and coherence.<br><br>Here is a revised version of the clause:<br><br>"Reata, as the target company, hereby covenants to conduct its business in the ordinary and usual course between the signing of the merger agreement and the Effective Time. Reata shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that its operations are conducted in all material respects according to its ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practice. Furthermore, Reata shall not undertake any specified actions or make any changes without prior approval by the buyer."<br><br>Reasoning for the suggested edits:<br>1. The revised version explicitly mentions Reata as the target company and introduces the covenant.<br>2. The revised version clearly states the requirement for Reata to conduct its business in the ordinary and usual course during the specified period.<br>3. The revised version adds clarity by emphasizing the usage of reasonable best efforts in conducting operations.<br>4. The revised version includes a clear prohibition of specified actions or changes without prior approval.<br><br>The suggested edits improve the clarity and alignment of the clause with the playbook's elements, making it more effective and legally sound.

However, prior to the receipt of the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Reata Common Stock to adopt of the Merger Agreement and approve of the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Reata Stockholder Approval”), the “no-shop” provision allows Reata, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement (including promptly advising Biogen of receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof), to provide non-public information and engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal if the Reata Board, after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.</p><p>Reata will prepare and file a proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and, subject to certain exceptions, the Reata Board will recommend that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Reata’s stockholders at the Reata Special Meeting. Prior to the receipt of the Reata Stockholder Approval, the Reata Board may withdraw or modify its recommendation that Reata’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby if it, after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith (i) that it has received a Superior Proposal or (ii) an Intervening Event (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has occurred, in each case, subject to providing notice to Biogen and complying with other specified conditions, including giving Biogen the opportunity to propose revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement during a match right period.</p><p><em>Closing Conditions</em></p><p>The obligation of the parties to consummate the Merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including: (i) receipt of the Reata Stockholder Approval, (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, and</p><ol><li>the absence of any law or order prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the acquisition of the Reata Common Stock by Biogen or the Merger. In addition, each of and Biogen’s and Reata’s obligations to consummate the Merger are subject to certain matters, including: (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties given by the other party (subject to customary materiality qualifiers), and (ii) performance, and compliance with, in all material respects, the agreements and covenants required to be performed, or complied with, by the other party under the Merger Agreement. Biogen’s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to (i) the non-occurrence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) the absence of any law or order that is in effect and imposes a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (iii) the absence of any pending legal proceeding that seeks to (A) have the effect of making illegal or prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the acquisition of the Reata Common Stock by Biogen or Merger Sub or (B) impose a Burdensome Condition.

        The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for Biogen and Reata, including the right of either party to terminate the Merger Agreement if (i) the Merger is not consummated by January 28, 2024 (the “Outside Date”) (subject to any extension in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement), (ii) the Reata Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Reata Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, (iii) a law or order permanently restraining, enjoining, preventing or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger has become final and non-appealable, or (iv) the other party breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made in the Merger Agreement, and such breach remains uncured for twenty business days (if curable). Biogen may terminate the Merger Agreement if (i) any law or order imposing a Burdensome Condition has become final and non-appealable, or (ii) prior to obtaining stockholder approval, the Reata Board changes its recommendation that Reata’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby (a “Recommendation Change”). Reata may terminate the Merger Agreement if, prior to obtaining stockholder approval, the Reata Board in good faith determines that it has received a Superior Proposal and terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal (subject to payment of a termination fee described below).

       The suggested revised clause is as follows:<br><br>The Merger Agreement includes several termination rights for Biogen and Reata. Either party has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement under the following circumstances:<br>1.

If the Reata Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Reata Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.<br>3. If a law or order is issued that permanently restrains, enjoins, prevents, or otherwise prohibits or renders illegal the completion of the Merger, and such judgment or order is final and non-appealable.<br>4. If the other party breaches any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement made in the Merger Agreement, and such breach remains unresolved for twenty business days (if curable).<br><br>In addition, Biogen may terminate the Merger Agreement if:<br>1. Any law or order imposes a Burdensome Condition, and such law or order is final and non-appealable.<br>2.

The funding of the Bridge Facility provided for in the Commitment Letter is contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions, including (i) the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the Bridge Facility in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter and (ii) the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.</p><p><em>Voting and Support Agreements</em></p><p>On July 28, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Biogen and Merger Sub entered into a voting and support agreement (each, a “Support Agreement” and, together, the “Support Agreements”) with each of William E.

This Agreement (including any schedules, annexes and exhibits hereto) and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; <em>provided</em>, <em>however</em>, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties) under this Agreement. Any party’s pursuit of any injunction or specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving Willful Breach or Common Law Fraud; <em>provided</em>, <em>however</em>, that (i) in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to both the payment of the Company Termination Fee, on the one hand, and specific performance, on the other hand, and (ii) in no event shall the Company be entitled to both the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, on the one hand, and specific performance, on the other hand.</li></ol><p>9.9 Governing Law.
